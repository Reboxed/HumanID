# HumanReadable

It's a Go packaged developed and used by Rebxd responsible for generating human-readable random ids from integers (like “graceful-experimental-monkey-41”) mostly popular in SaaS products.  
This was developed as part of Rebxds “core in-house libraries” and will be continuously improved upon and expanded while staying forever Open-Source.
